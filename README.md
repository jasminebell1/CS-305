# CS-305
Final project from cs305 Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client was artemis financial. As they modernize their web interface, they sought out a third party (Me) to implement modern software security to their application

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

 I successfully detected and resolved security weaknesses in the client's software through actions like incorporating checksum verification and utilizing more robust cryptographic hashing algorithms. Ensuring secure coding is essential in preventing data breaches, safeguarding sensitive data, and upholding user confidence. Software security plays a vital role in improving a company's overall health by preserving its reputation, minimizing financial threats, and adhering to regulatory requirements. The most difficult aspect of the vulnerability assessment involved guaranteeing thorough protection against possible attack paths and determining security measures according to risk evaluation.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I enhanced the security measures by incorporating checksum verification, employing more robust cryptographic hashing algorithms, and establishing effective error handling for algorithm unavailability. Moving forward, I intend to employ a blend of automated vulnerability scanning tools, penetration testing, and code reviews to thoroughly evaluate vulnerabilities. These techniques will aid in prioritizing mitigation strategies based on the severity of identified vulnerabilities and the unique requirements of the software application.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

 I verified the functionality and security of the code and software application through comprehensive testing, which included unit tests, integration tests, and security testing. Following the code refactoring, I conducted regression testing to detect any newly introduced vulnerabilities. Additionally, I carried out code reviews and utilized static analysis tools to pinpoint potential security concerns.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

In upcoming projects or duties, I will consider using tools like security libraries, frameworks such as Spring Security, and security-oriented coding techniques like input validation, output encoding, and secure configuration management to improve software security. Moreover, employing security assessment tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite for dynamic analysis, in combination with static code analysis tools like SonarQube, can guarantee both code quality and security.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I can exhibit the refactored code to prospective employers, accompanied by a summary of security enhancements carried out during the vulnerability assessment. Moreover, I can furnish documentation outlining the security measures implemented, including the addition of checksum verification and the upgrading of hashing algorithms. This demonstrates my capability to effectively identify and rectify security vulnerabilities. This project underscores my competencies in secure coding practices, risk assessment, and software security enhancement, all of which are valuable assets for any organization prioritizing the protection of sensitive data and the integrity of their software applications.
